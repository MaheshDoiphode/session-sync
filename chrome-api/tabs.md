chrome.tabs 

bookmark_border
Note: The Tabs API can be used by the service worker and extension pages, but not content scripts.
Use the chrome.tabs API to interact with the browser's tab system. You can use this API to create, modify, and rearrange tabs in the browser.

The Tabs API not only offers features for manipulating and managing tabs, but can also detect the language of the tab, take a screenshot, and communicate with a tab's content scripts.

Permissions
Most features don't require any permissions to use. For example: creating a new tab, reloading a tab, navigating to another URL, etc.

There are three permissions developers should be aware of when working with the Tabs API.

The "tabs" permission
This permission does not give access to the chrome.tabs namespace. Instead, it grants an extension the ability to call tabs.query() against four sensitive properties on tabs.Tab instances: url, pendingUrl, title, and favIconUrl.


{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "tabs"
  ],
  ...
}
Host permissions
Host permissions allow an extension to read and query a matching tab's four sensitive tabs.Tab properties. They can also interact directly with the matching tabs using methods such as tabs.captureVisibleTab(), scripting.executeScript(), scripting.insertCSS(), and scripting.removeCSS().

{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "host_permissions": [
    "http://*/*",
    "https://*/*"
  ],
  ...
}
The "activeTab" permission
activeTab grants an extension temporary host permission for the current tab in response to a user invocation. Unlike host permissions, activeTab does not trigger any warnings.

{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab"
  ],
  ...
}
Use cases
The following sections demonstrate some common use cases.

Open an extension page in a new tab
A common pattern for extensions is to open an onboarding page in a new tab when the extension is installed. The following example shows how to do this.

background.js:


chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(({reason}) => {
  if (reason === 'install') {
    chrome.tabs.create({
      url: "onboarding.html"
    });
  }
});
Note: This example doesn't require any permissions.
Get the current tab
This example demonstrates how an extension's service worker can retrieve the active tab from the currently-focused window (or most recently-focused window, if no Chrome windows are focused). This can usually be thought of as the user's current tab.



  async function getCurrentTab() {
    let queryOptions = { active: true, lastFocusedWindow: true };
    // `tab` will either be a `tabs.Tab` instance or `undefined`.
    let [tab] = await chrome.tabs.query(queryOptions);
    return tab;
  }


  function getCurrentTab(callback) {
    let queryOptions = { active: true, lastFocusedWindow: true };
    chrome.tabs.query(queryOptions, ([tab]) => {
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError)
      console.error(chrome.runtime.lastError);
      // `tab` will either be a `tabs.Tab` instance or `undefined`.
      callback(tab);
    });
  }

Mute the specified tab
This example shows how an extension can toggle the muted state for a given tab.



  async function toggleMuteState(tabId) {
    const tab = await chrome.tabs.get(tabId);
    const muted = !tab.mutedInfo.muted;
    await chrome.tabs.update(tabId, {muted});
    console.log(`Tab ${tab.id} is ${muted ? "muted" : "unmuted"}`);
  }

  function toggleMuteState(tabId) {
    chrome.tabs.get(tabId, async (tab) => {
      let muted = !tab.mutedInfo.muted;
      await chrome.tabs.update(tabId, { muted });
      console.log(`Tab ${tab.id} is ${ muted ? "muted" : "unmuted" }`);
    });
  }

Move the current tab to the first position when clicked
This example shows how to move a tab while a drag may or may not be in progress. While this example uses chrome.tabs.move, you can use the same waiting pattern for other calls that modify tabs while a drag is in progress.


  chrome.tabs.onActivated.addListener(moveToFirstPosition);

  async function moveToFirstPosition(activeInfo) {
    try {
      await chrome.tabs.move(activeInfo.tabId, {index: 0});
      console.log("Success.");
    } catch (error) {
      if (error == "Error: Tabs cannot be edited right now (user may be dragging a tab).") {
        setTimeout(() => moveToFirstPosition(activeInfo), 50);
      } else {
        console.error(error);
      }
    }
  }
Important: Using catch(error) in a Promise is a way to ensure that an error that otherwise populates `chrome.runtime.lastError` is not unchecked.

  chrome.tabs.onActivated.addListener(moveToFirstPositionMV2);

  function moveToFirstPositionMV2(activeInfo) {
    chrome.tabs.move(activeInfo.tabId, { index: 0 }, () => {
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
        const error = chrome.runtime.lastError;
        if (error == "Error: Tabs cannot be edited right now (user may be dragging a tab).") {
          setTimeout(() => moveToFirstPositionMV2(activeInfo), 50);
        } else {
          console.error(error);
        }
      } else {
        console.log("Success.");
      }
    });
  }

Pass a message to a selected tab's content script
This example demonstrates how an extension's service worker can communicate with content scripts in specific browser tabs using tabs.sendMessage().

function sendMessageToActiveTab(message) {
  const [tab] = await chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, lastFocusedWindow: true });
  const response = await chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, message);
  // TODO: Do something with the response.
}

Tab
Properties

ZoomSettings
Defines how zoom changes in a tab are handled and at what scope.

Properties
defaultZoomFactor
number optional

Chrome 43+
Used to return the default zoom level for the current tab in calls to tabs.getZoomSettings.

mode
ZoomSettingsMode optional

Defines how zoom changes are handled, i.e., which entity is responsible for the actual scaling of the page; defaults to automatic.

scope
ZoomSettingsScope optional

Defines whether zoom changes persist for the page's origin, or only take effect in this tab; defaults to per-origin when in automatic mode, and per-tab otherwise.

ZoomSettingsMode
Chrome 44+
Defines how zoom changes are handled, i.e., which entity is responsible for the actual scaling of the page; defaults to automatic.

Enum

"automatic"
Zoom changes are handled automatically by the browser.

"manual"
Overrides the automatic handling of zoom changes. The onZoomChange event will still be dispatched, and it is the extension's responsibility to listen for this event and manually scale the page. This mode does not support per-origin zooming, and thus ignores the scope zoom setting and assumes per-tab.

"disabled"
Disables all zooming in the tab. The tab reverts to the default zoom level, and all attempted zoom changes are ignored.

ZoomSettingsScope
Chrome 44+
Defines whether zoom changes persist for the page's origin, or only take effect in this tab; defaults to per-origin when in automatic mode, and per-tab otherwise.

Enum

"per-origin"
Zoom changes persist in the zoomed page's origin, i.e., all other tabs navigated to that same origin are zoomed as well. Moreover, per-origin zoom changes are saved with the origin, meaning that when navigating to other pages in the same origin, they are all zoomed to the same zoom factor. The per-origin scope is only available in the automatic mode.

"per-tab"
Zoom changes only take effect in this tab, and zoom changes in other tabs do not affect the zooming of this tab. Also, per-tab zoom changes are reset on navigation; navigating a tab always loads pages with their per-origin zoom factors.

Properties
MAX_CAPTURE_VISIBLE_TAB_CALLS_PER_SECOND
Chrome 92+
The maximum number of times that captureVisibleTab can be called per second. captureVisibleTab is expensive and should not be called too often.

Value
2

TAB_ID_NONE
Chrome 46+
An ID that represents the absence of a browser tab.

Value
-1

TAB_INDEX_NONE
Chrome 123+
An index that represents the absence of a tab index in a tab_strip.

Value
-1

Methods
captureVisibleTab()
Promise
chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab(
  windowId?: number,
  options?: ImageDetails,
  callback?: function,
)
Captures the visible area of the currently active tab in the specified window. In order to call this method, the extension must have either the <all_urls> permission or the activeTab permission. In addition to sites that extensions can normally access, this method allows extensions to capture sensitive sites that are otherwise restricted, including chrome:-scheme pages, other extensions' pages, and data: URLs. These sensitive sites can only be captured with the activeTab permission. File URLs may be captured only if the extension has been granted file access.

options
ImageDetails optional
